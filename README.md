# Project Pathfinder

## Purpose

**Goal of this project:** Ease the process of figuring out admission requirements at [Copenhagen Business School (CBS)](https://www.cbs.dk/en).

**Goal of this repository:** Prove that the crux of this project is not software engineering related.

## Background

Across my years at CBS, I [(Tomas Vemola)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomasvemola/) have been a part of a number of steering groups, working groups and initiatives across CBS.

One of those initiatives was the "Programme Portfolio Review".

CBS has over 60 programmes, approximately half-half undergraduate-graduate. Making sense of the portfolio is a major hurdle - for employers, and students alike.

The objective of the Programme Portfolio Review was to simplify the portfolio, so that it would be more easily comprehensible by a variety of stakeholders.

I have been a part of this group for about 1.5 years and as far as I can say, the only meaningful outcome for students was this: the group agreed (or disagreed silently :D ) that we should build an interface that helps (undergraduate) students understand their options in terms of progressing through CBS.

Something along the lines of

1. select all courses that you have passed
2. click a magic button
3. get a list of your options for a graduate programme
   1. legal claim (certainty of admission under Danish legal system)
   2. fulfilling all criteria (possibility of admission)
   3. not fulfilling all criteria (possibility of admission if criteria are fulfilled)
      - show which criteria need to be fulfilled
   4. unfulfillable criteria

Nevertheless, then circumstances happened, lack of resources, public institution bureaucracy...

So anyway, I decided to build it myself, right here in this very repo (☞ ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)☞
