    -   Over the past couple of days, I think I got to an MVP
        -   ☑️ Searchable list of courses
        -   ☑️ Data crunching of admission criteria based on input
        -   ☑️ Displaying results in a layperson-readable format
        -   ☑️ Code is not extraordinarily atrocious
    -   What prevents me from getting to a v.1 is data from CBS on courses and programmes. This will probably be what this project dies on, because I doubt that CBS is aligned on what each course "is worth" in terms of splitting ECTS into specific areas.
