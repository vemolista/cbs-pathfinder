  - Didn't journal the last couple of days, oops
    - On Tuesday 12th I mightily struggled with getting output from the rule engine function that evaluates rules to a component. Obvious that I don't understand Promises and all that shit.
    - Wednesday was all about traversing the rule engine output object. Managed to write a recursive function that console logs all the info I need. Spend so much time trying to traverse the typed object (`TopLevelCondition`), but couldn't make it happen. Then I just gave up and went full dummy `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(input))` to get rid of the types. :KEKW:
  - And todaaay is about taking that recursive function and make it render the component displaying rule results instead of console.logging() it
